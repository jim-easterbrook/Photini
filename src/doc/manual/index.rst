User manual
===========

This manual attempts to cover every part of Photini in detail, but still be usable as a tutorial.
I suggest you read the :doc:`image selector <image_selector>` and :doc:`descriptive metadata <descriptive_metadata>` sections first, then read other sections when you start using the relevant features.
