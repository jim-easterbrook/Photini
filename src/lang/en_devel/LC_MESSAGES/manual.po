msgid "These are stored in a 5-level hierarchy: ``street``, ``city``, ``province``, ``country`` and ``region``. The meaning of these terms is rather loose, especially when out in the countryside, and there's no requirement to fill them all in. Typically ``city`` can be anything from a village to a metropolis, and ``street`` is a more specific location, e.g. \"23 Abdication Avenue\". ``Province`` would be a state in the USA or a county in the UK. ``Country`` is stored as a name and a 2 or 3 letter `ISO code`_. ``Region`` appears to be rarely used but could be a continent or sub-continent. More detail about these can be found on the `IPTC web site`_."

The first option is to always write IPTC-IIM metadata. You may need this if you use other software that reads IPTC-IIM but not XMP.
