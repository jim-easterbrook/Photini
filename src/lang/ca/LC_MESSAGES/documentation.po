msgid "Location addresses"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"The ``Address`` tab shows text address data for the location from where the "
"photograph was taken (``camera``) and one or more locations shown in the "
"photograph (``subject``). For example, if the subject location is the Eiffel"
" Tower then the camera location is almost certainly somewhere else in Paris."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Locations are stored in a 5-level hierarchy: ``street``, ``city``, "
"``province``, ``country`` and ``region``. The meaning of these terms is "
"rather vague, especially when out in the countryside, and there's no "
"requirement to fill them all in. Typically ``city`` can be anything from a "
"village to a metropolis, and ``street`` is a more specific location, e.g. "
"\"23 Abdication Avenue\". ``Province`` would be a state in the USA or a "
"county in the UK. ``Country`` is stored as a name and a 2 or 3 letter `ISO "
"code`_. ``Region`` appears to be rarely used but could be a continent or "
"sub-continent."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"``Name``, ``Location ID``, and GPS data are recent additions to the IPTC "
"location specification. More detail about all of these can be found on the "
"`IPTC web site`_."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Note that \"legacy\" IPTC-IIM address metadata only stores the ``street``, "
"``city``, ``province``, and ``country`` fields and only the ``camera`` "
"location."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"The ``Get address from lat, long`` button uses \"reverse geocoding\" to "
"convert latitude & longitude into a hierarchical address. This is a rather "
"imprecise process so you may need to edit the results yourself. The address "
"lookup service is provided by OpenCage_, using data from OpenStreetMap_. "
"Other map providers don't allow lookup results to be permanently stored."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Photini attempts to use all the data returned in an address lookup. This can"
" lead to some duplication, e.g. Château-Gontier appears twice in ``city``. "
"Note also the blue underlining indicating text that is too long to store in "
"IPTC-IIM metadata."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Scrolling down shows the latitude and longitude of the location. Note that "
"these are not the same as the GPS coordinates shown at the top left. The "
"reverse geocoding process chooses a \"place\" (address, business, landmark, "
"etc.) near the actual coordinates and it is the coordinates of that place "
"that are shown in the ``camera`` address."
msgstr ""

msgid "It is usually necessary to edit the address quite a lot."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Right-clicking on a location tab displays a context menu that allows the tab"
" to be copied to a new tab or deleted. Copying the ``camera`` location is an"
" easy way to initialise a ``subject`` location. (An empty ``subject 2`` tab "
"is immediately created, in case the photograph has more than one subject.)"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"In this case most of the data is the same, but I changed ``street`` to the "
"subject of the photograph rather than the place where I was standing, and "
"then deleted the latitude & longitude."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"To reorder the subject locations, or to convert between camera and subject, "
"you can drag any of the tabs to another position. Photini ensures there is "
"always one empty subject location ready to be filled in."
msgstr ""

msgid "Configuration"
msgstr "Configuració"

msgid ""
"If there are tabs in the Photini GUI that you don't use, you can remove them"
" by deselecting their entry in the ``Options`` menu."
msgstr ""
"Si hi ha pestanyes obertes en l'interficie del Photini que no feu servir, "
"les podeu esborra desmarcant-ne l'entrada en el menú ``Opcions``"

msgid ""
"The ``Options`` menu also has a ``Settings`` item which opens the dialog "
"shown below."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"The first three items adjust how Photini uses IPTC-IIM \"legacy\" metadata. "
"(Since 2004 the `IPTC standard`_ uses XMP to store metadata. Photini always "
"writes these XMP fields.) The first option is to always write IPTC-IIM "
"metadata. You may need this if you use other software that reads IPTC-IIM "
"but not XMP. The second option only writes IPTC-IIM metadata if it is "
"already present in the file, as recommended by the `Metadata Working "
"Group`_. The third option is to delete any IPTC-IIM metadata that might be "
"present."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"IPTC-IIM metadata has limited length for some fields. Photini truncates the "
"IPTC-IIM data if necessary, but the full length data is still stored in Exif"
" and / or XMP. Text that exceeds the IPTC-IIM length is shown with a blue "
"underline. If you don't need to worry about IPTC-IIM compatibility you can "
"disable this warning."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Sidecar files allow metadata to be stored without needing to write to the "
"actual image file. If you deselect \"write to image file\" then sidecars "
"will always be created. Otherwise, you can choose to have them always "
"created (storing data in parallel with the image file), only created when "
"necessary (e.g. an image file is write protected), or deleted when possible "
"(if metadata can be copied to the image file the sidecar is deleted)."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Next there are options to adjust file timestamps. \"Keep original\" leaves "
"image files' timestamps unchanged. \"Set to when photo was taken\" changes "
"files' timestamps to the date & time taken (as shown on the technical tab). "
"\"Set to when the file is saved\" sets files' timestamps to when you save "
"the file with Photini, like most other computer programs do. You may find "
"these options useful if you often use a file browser to sort files by date."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"If you have installed gpxpy_ then there is a final option to determine if "
"the altitude is included when a GPX file is used to set pictures' GPS data."
msgstr ""

msgid "Spell checking"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"The ``Spelling`` menu allows you to enable or disable spell checking on "
"Photini's text fields, and to select the language dictionary to use. The "
"available languages depend on what dictionaries you have installed. Adding "
"extra languages on Linux is easy -- just use your system's package manager "
"to install the appropriate dictionary (and make sure you have the "
"appropriate enchant \"backend\" installed)."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Windows programs don't share spell checking dictionaries as easily as on "
"Linux. The Hunspell `LibreOffice dictionaries`_ can be used. Select the "
"subdirectory with the language you need (e.g. ``fr_FR`` for French as spoken"
" in France) and download the ``.aff`` and ``.dic`` files. (Ignore hyphen and"
" thesaurus files.) Put these files in the same directory as the English "
"dictionaries installed with pyenchant. On my computer the directory is "
"``C:\\Users\\Jim\\AppData\\Local\\Programs\\Python\\Python38\\Lib\\`` "
"``site-packages\\enchant\\data\\mingw64\\share\\enchant\\hunspell`` but this"
" will depend on your Python installation."
msgstr ""

msgid "Configuration file location"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Photini stores its configuration in a file called ``editor.ini``. The "
"default location of this file is ``$HOME/.config/photini/`` (Linux), "
"``$HOME/Library/Preferences/photini`` (MacOS), or "
"``%USERPROFILE%\\AppData\\Local\\photini\\`` (Windows). If you'd like to "
"store it elsewhere (e.g. on a networked drive so you can share configuration"
" between several computers) you can set an environment variable "
"``PHOTINI_CONFIG`` to the directory you'd like to use."
msgstr ""

msgid "PyQt options"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"The configuration file includes options to select use of PyQt5, PyQt6, "
"PySide2, or PySide6. These may be useful if one of these components on your "
"computer is incompatible with Photini. There are so many versions of PyQt "
"that it is impossible to test Photini with every one."
msgstr ""

msgid "The default options in the configuration file are in the ``[pyqt]`` section:"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"To force use of a particular Qt library set the value of ``qt_lib`` to "
"``'PyQt5'``, ``'PyQt6'``, ``'PySide2'``, or ``'PySide6'``. (You can also use"
" the ``photini-configure`` command to set this.) You can check which "
"versions Photini is currently using by running it in a command window with "
"the ``--version`` option::"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"If your computer has a high resolution screen, or you have poor eyesight, "
"you may find the Photini user interface's text is too small to read "
"comfortably. Setting ``scale_factor`` to a value larger than ``1`` should "
"enlarge Photini. Using non-integer values is possible, but might show "
"artefacts from the scaling."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Setting the ``native_dialog`` option to ``False`` makes Photini use a Qt "
"dialog to select files to open instead of the normal operating system "
"dialog."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Note that there is no GUI to set these options. You may need to adjust them "
"if Photini crashes on startup, in which case the GUI would be unusable. The "
"configuration file can be edited with any plain text editing program."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Make sure your editor doesn't change the file's encoding (e.g. from utf-8 to"
" iso-8859) or insert a \"byte order mark\"."
msgstr ""

msgid "Application style"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Qt applications can have their appearance changed by selecting different "
"\"styles\". Normally a style is automatically chosen that suits the "
"operating system, but you may want to override this if you prefer something "
"different. For example, on one of my computers the default style doesn't "
"draw lines round the grouped elements on the uploader tabs, so I change the "
"style to one that does."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"The choice of style affects how some \"widgets\" are drawn. If you find "
"problems such as date or timezone values (on the \"technical metadata\" tab)"
" being partly hidden then it might be worth trying another style."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"To find out what styles are available on your computer you can use Photini's"
" ``--version`` flag. (You need to run Photini from a command window to do "
"this, see the :ref:`installation troubleshooting<installation-"
"troubleshooting>` section.) You can then try one of these styles as "
"follows::"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Note that the style names are not case sensitive. If none of the available "
"styles is to your liking you may be able to install extra ones. For example,"
" on some Ubuntu Linux systems the package ``qt5-style-plugins`` is "
"available."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Once you find a style that you like, you can set Photini to use that style "
"by editing the configuration file as described above. Add a line such as "
"``style = cleanlooks`` to the ``[pyqt]`` section to set your chosen style. "
"Note that after doing this you can not set a different style on the command "
"line unless you remove the ``style = ...`` line from your config file."
msgstr ""

msgid "Tab order"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"The tabs can be re-ordered by dragging and dropping a tab to your preferred "
"position. This is much easier to do than editing the configuration file."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Photini's tabs can be enabled or disabled with the ``Options`` menu as "
"described above, but their order is set in the configuration file. The "
"``[tabs]`` section has a ``modules`` entry which lists the modules to be "
"imported for each tab. You can reorder the tabs by reordering this list."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"You could even use a tab provided by another Python package by adding its "
"module name to the list. See :doc:`extending` for more information."
msgstr ""

msgid "Descriptive metadata"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"The ``Descriptive metadata`` tab (keyboard shortcut ``Alt+D``) allows you to"
" edit basic information about your photographs, such as the title and "
"description."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"The data form is disabled until you select one or more images to edit. "
"Hovering the mouse over one of the data fields displays a popup \"tooltip\" "
"describing the sort of information to put in that field. This help text is "
"taken from the `IPTC standard`_."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"The first thing I usually do with a new set of photographs is to set the "
"title. Select all the images that should have the same title, then type the "
"title in the ``Title / Object name`` text editing box. Note that the title "
"(and headline and keywords) are stored in XMP and IPTC-IIM but not in Exif, "
"so may not be visible to software that only handles Exif metadata (see "
":doc:`tag reference <tags>` for more detail). You may prefer to leave these "
"fields blank."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"The legacy IPTC-IIM standard has a maximum number of bytes for each data "
"item. If your text has more bytes then the excess is shown underlined in "
"blue. You can ignore this if you don't need compatibility with old software "
"that relies on IPTC-IIM data. This warning can be turned off in Photini's "
":doc:`configuration <configuration>`."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"The ``Title / Object name`` field has an optional spell checker, enabled "
"with the ``Spelling`` menu. The word \"Château-Gontier\" is not in the "
"British English dictionary, as indicated by the red underlining. Right-"
"clicking on a misspelled word shows any suggested alternatives, one of which"
" can be chosen by clicking on it."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Note that all the image thumbnails now have a warning symbol (|hazard|) "
"displayed next to them. This shows that they have unsaved metadata edits. "
"The ``File`` menu ``Save images with new data`` item (keyboard shortcut "
"``Ctrl+S``) saves your edits and clears the warning symbols, as shown below."
" I do this frequently to avoid losing any of my work."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Now you can add more detail in the ``Headline`` and / or ``Description / "
"Caption`` boxes. (My descriptions are usually so short that a separate "
"headline summary isn't needed.) There are probably only one or two "
"photographs that share the same description, so select those images first."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"If you select a group of images you may see ``<multiple values>`` displayed "
"in some of the text boxes. You can right-click on the box to bring up a "
"context menu from which you can choose a value to be copied to all the "
"selected photographs. Very long texts are elided with ``...`` replacing some"
" of the text."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"The ``Alt Text (Accessibility)`` and ``Extended Description "
"(Accessibility)`` boxes are where you describe the photograph for visually "
"impaired users. These are a recent addition to the `IPTC standard`_ - in "
"future image display programs and web sites should use this metadata to "
"create their \"ALT text\" image description."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Next you can set a list of keywords for the image by typing them in the "
"``Keywords`` box. Keywords should be separated by semi-colon (;) characters."
" The ``<favourites>`` drop-down list can be used to select keywords from the"
" ones you use most often."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Finally the ``Rating`` slider allows you to note any particularly good or "
"bad pictures. Good pictures can be given a one to five star rating."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Bad pictures can be given a ``reject`` rating. This is stored in the "
"metadata as a rating value of -1."
msgstr ""

msgid "Alternative Languages"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Some fields, such as title and description, are stored in XMP as `Lang Alt`_"
" data. This allows translations into alternative languages to be stored "
"along with the default language text. (Only the default language is stored "
"in Exif and IPTC-IIM.)"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Photini has a language drop down selector next to each ``Lang Alt`` data "
"field. If the current text is in an unspecified default language the "
"selector shows ``Language``, otherwise it shows ``Lang:`` and the current "
"language. If the field is empty the current language is set to your "
"computer's default locale. You can add an alternative language by clicking "
"on the drop down and selecting ``<new>``."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"If there is already some text in an unspecified default language you will be"
" asked to say what that language is. Languages are specified with an "
"RFC3066_ code. This usually starts with a two-letter language code, e.g. "
"``en`` for English, and may be followed by a hyphen and a two-letter country"
" code, e.g. ``en-GB`` for English as spoken in Great Britain."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Next you can set the language to be added, e.g. ``fr-FR`` for French as "

msgstr ""

msgid "You can then type the translation in to the text field."

msgstr ""

msgid ""
"It is possible to add new functionality to Photini by providing a new "

msgid ""
"Linux & MacOS users have another decision to make - whether to install "

"Photini's dependencies can be installed with pip_, but I recommend "
"installing PySide6 / PySide2 / PyQt6 / PyQt5 (whichever is available) with "

"within the virtual environment. Note that pip may need to be updated again "
"from within the virtual environment."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Note that after activating the virtual environment the ``py`` command is not"

msgid "String length"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Many of the strings to be translated have to fit into buttons on the GUI, so"

"to as well."
msgstr ""

msgid "Words with special meanings"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Some of Photini's GUI elements such as ``Title / Object Name`` are named "

"with translating these words."
msgstr ""

msgid "Formatting strings"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"In Python curly braces are used to include other data in a string. For "
"example, ``File \"{file_name}\" has {size} bytes and exceeds {service}'s "
"limit of {max_size} bytes.`` includes the file name & size and a size limit "

"language."
msgstr ""

msgid "Carriage returns"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Some of Photini's buttons split their labels over two or more lines to stop "
"the button being too wide. You should split your translation in similar size"
" pieces so it has the same number of lines."
msgstr ""

msgid "HTML markup"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Strings such as ``<h3>Upload to Flickr has not finished.</h3>`` include HTML"
" markup which must be copied to your translated string. Some strings such as"
" ``<multiple values>`` are not HTML. The angle brackets ``<>`` are used to "
"indicate data with a special meaning. These strings should usually be "
"translated."
msgstr ""

msgid "Keyboard shortcuts"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Some strings include a single ampersand character ``&`` immediately before a"

msgid "Plural forms"

msgid ""
"Translations can accommodate the many ways that languages handle plurals. "
"For example in English we write \"0 files, 1 file, 2 files\". Weblate_ has a"

msgstr ""

msgid ""
"The Photini documentation is written in `reStructuredText "
"<http://docutils.sourceforge.net/rst.html>`_. This is a markup language that"
" looks very like plain text, but uses certain characters to give extra "
"meaning to some parts. You need to take extra care when the string to be "
"translated includes such markup. The markup often needs to be preceded or "
"followed by a space or other punctuation. Take care to copy spaces and "
"punctuation from the English source."
msgstr ""

msgid "Double backquotes ``````"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"These often mark words that are used in the Photini GUI. You may wish to "
