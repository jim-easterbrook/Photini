msgid "Installation"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Installation of Photini is done in two parts - first install Python, then "
"use Python to install and run Photini."
msgstr ""

msgid "Installing Python"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Python_ is absolutely essential to run Photini. It is already installed on "
"many computers, but on Windows you will probably need to install it "
"yourself."
msgstr ""

msgid "Linux/MacOS"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Python should already be installed, but make sure you have Python |nbsp| 3. "
"Open a terminal window and run the ``python3`` command::"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Note that the command is ``python3``. On many machines the ``python`` "
"command still runs Python |nbsp| 2. If you do not have Python |nbsp| 3 "
"installed then use your operating system's package manager to install it."
msgstr ""

msgid "You should also check what version of pip_ is installed::"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Most Linux systems suppress pip's normal version check, but I recommend "
"upgrading pip anyway::"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Note that pip has installed the new version in ``/home/jim/.local`` as "
"normal users can't write to ``/usr``. (Don't be tempted to get round this by"
" using ``sudo`` to run pip. ``/usr`` should only be written by the operating"
" system's package manager.) You may need to log out and then log in again to"
" update your PATH settings."
msgstr ""

msgid "Running ``pip --version`` again shows the new version::"
msgstr ""

msgid "Windows"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"I suggest reading `Using Python on Windows`_ before you begin. Go to "
"https://www.python.org/downloads/windows/ and choose a suitable Python "
"|nbsp| 3 installer. Use the 64-bit stable release with the highest version "
"number that will run on your version of Windows. Beware of using very new "
"releases though, as some dependencies may not have been updated to work with"
" the latest Python."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"When you run the Python installer make sure you select the \"add Python to "
"PATH\" option. If you customise your installation then make sure you still "
"select \"pip\". If you would like other users to be able to run Photini then"
" you need to install Python for all users (in the \"Advanced Options\" part "
"of customised installation)."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"After installing Python, start a command window such as ``cmd.exe``. Now try"
" running pip_::"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"As suggested, you should upgrade pip now. (If you installed Python for all "
"users you will need to run the shell as administrator.) Note that ``pip`` "
"must be run as ``python -m pip`` when upgrading itself::"
msgstr ""

# 5c1097b00e8c4caca7a8cbcc2fb3ce7f
msgid "Installing Photini"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Before installing Photini you need to decide if you are installing it for a "
"single user or for multiple users. Multi-user installations use a Python "
"`virtual environment`_ to create a self contained installation that can "
"easily be shared. Using a virtual environment has other advantages, such as "
"easy uninstallation, so you could also use it for a single user "
"installation."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Linux & MacOS users have another decision to make - whether to install "
"Photini's dependencies with pip_ or with the operating system's package "
"manager. For a good introduction to the advantages and disadvantages of each"
" I suggest reading `Managing Python packages the right way`_. All of "
"Photini's dependencies can be installed with pip_, but I recommend "
"installing PySide6 / PySide2 / PyQt6 / PyQt5 (whichever is available) with "
"the package manager to ensure you install all of its system libraries and "
"plugins, and so that you get the same GUI style as other Qt based "
"applications."
msgstr ""

msgid "Virtual environment"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"If you are using a virtual environment you should set it up now. I use the "
"name ``photini`` and create it in my home directory:"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Note that pip may need to be updated again from within the virtual "
"environment. The Linux/MacOS option ``--system-site-packages`` makes "
"packages installed with the system package manager (e.g. PySide6 / PySide2 /"
" PyQt6 / PyQt5) available within the virtual environment. You should stay in"
" this virtual environment while installing and testing Photini."
msgstr ""

msgid "Initial installation"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"The ``photini-configure`` post installation script can be used to install "
"most dependencies and configure Photini to use them."
msgstr ""

msgid "Firstly install Photini with pip_:"
msgstr ""

msgid "Now run the ``photini-configure`` command to choose which Qt package to use:"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"The command asks a series of questions, then runs pip_ to install any extra "
"dependencies that are needed, then updates your Photini configuration file."
msgstr ""

msgid "Test the installation"
msgstr ""

msgid "Now you should be able to run photini:"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Photini should run successfully, but it lists some optional dependencies "
"that are not installed. These provide additional features, for example the "
"Flickr uploader, that not all users will need to install."
msgstr ""

msgid "Missing system packages"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"On some Linux systems (e.g. Ubuntu, Debian, Mint) Photini may still not run "
"if you've installed PySide2 or PySide6 with pip_ instead of the system's "
"package manager. In this case it may be worth doing a web search for the "
"error messages you get. For example, failing to load a Qt plugin (on Debian)"
" can be cured by installing just one system package (``libxcb-xinerama0``) "
"but the error message doesn't tell you that!"
msgstr ""

# 14f0b75d219f4dc8bba2c817d988022b
msgid "Optional dependencies"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Most of the dependencies required for Photini's optional features can also "
"be installed with ``photini-configure``:"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Photini's spelling checker may require some other files to be installed. See"
" the `pyenchant documentation`_ for platform specific instructions."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"One optional dependency that cannot be installed with pip_ or ``photini-"
"configure`` is FFmpeg_. This is used to read metadata from video files. "
"Linux & MacOS users can install it with the system package manager, but "
"installing it on Windows is non-trivial."
msgstr ""

msgid "Start menu / application menu"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Although you can run Photini from a command shell, most users would probably"
" prefer to use the start/application menu or a desktop icon. These can be "
"installed with the ``photini-post-install`` command:"
msgstr ""

msgid "Additional users"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"If you have installed Photini in a virtual environment then other users "
"should be able to run the ``photini`` command using its full path. (On "
"Windows you will need to share the virtual environment top level directory "
"first.)"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"This is not a very convenient way to run Photini, so most users will want to"
" add it to their start/application menu:"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"To install Photini menu shortcuts for all users you can run the post install"
" command as root (Linux) or in a command window run as administrator "
"(Windows). It is important to use the full path to the post install command:"
msgstr ""

msgid "Uninstalling Photini"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Before removing Photini you should use the ``photini-post-install`` command "
"to remove it from the start/application menu:"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"If you used a virtual environment you can simply delete the top level "
"directory created when setting up the virtual environment. Otherwise you can"
" use pip to uninstall Photini and as many of its dependencies as you want to"
" remove:"
msgstr ""

msgid "Updating Photini"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"When a new release of Photini is issued you can easily update your "
"installation with pip_:"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"The ``-U`` option tells pip to update Photini to the latest available "
"version."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"If you upgrade Python you shouldn't need to reinstall Photini or its "
"dependencies if only the patch level changes (e.g. 3.8.9 to 3.8.10). After a"
" more significant Python upgrade (e.g. 3.7.x to 3.8.y) you will need to do a"
" fresh installation of Photini and its dependencies."
msgstr ""

msgid "Dependency details"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"These lists of dependencies may be useful to Linux or MacOS users who prefer"
" to use their system package manager to install them instead of pip_. Note "
"that in some cases you have a choice of packages, as discussed in the notes "
"below each table."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Different operating systems have different names for the same packages. If "
"you run into problems, please let me know (email jim@jim-easterbrook.me.uk) "
"and once we've worked out what needs to be done I'll be able to improve "
"these instructions."
