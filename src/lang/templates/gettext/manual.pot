msgid "Location addresses"
msgstr ""

msgid "The ``Address`` tab shows text address data for the location from where the photograph was taken (``camera``) and one or more locations shown in the photograph (``subject``). For example, a general view of the Eiffel Tower will almost certainly have been taken from somewhere else in Paris."
msgstr ""

msgid "These are stored in a 5-level hierarchy: ``street``, ``city``, ``province``, ``country`` and ``region``. The meaning of these terms is rather loose, especially when out in the countryside, and there's no requirement to fill them all in. Typically ``city`` can be anything from a village to a metropolis, and ``street`` is a more specific location, e.g. \"23 Abdication Avenue\". ``Province`` would be a state in the USA or a county in the UK. ``Country`` is stored as a name and a 2 or 3 letter `ISO code`_. ``Region`` appears to be rarely used but could be a continent or sub-continent. More detail about these can be found on the `IPTC web site`_."
msgstr ""

msgid "The separation of camera and subject addresses was added to the IPTC specification in 2008, but you may still have software that only recognises \"legacy\" IPTC-IIM address metadata. In this case you should not use the ``subject`` tabs or ``region`` field."
msgstr ""

msgid "The ``Get address from lat, long`` button uses \"reverse geocoding\" to convert latitude & longitude into a hierarchical address. This is a rather imprecise process so you may need to edit the results yourself. The address lookup service is provided by OpenCage_, using data from OpenStreetMap_. Other map providers don't allow lookup results to be permanently stored."
msgstr ""

msgid "Photini attempts to use all the data returned in an address lookup. This can lead to some duplication, e.g. Château-Gontier appears twice in ``city``. Note also the blue underlining indicating text that is too long to store in IPTC-IIM metadata."
msgstr ""

msgid "It is usually necessary to edit the address quite a lot."
msgstr ""

msgid "Right-clicking on a location tab displays a context menu that allows the tab to be copied to a new tab or deleted. Copying the ``camera`` location is an easy way to initialise a ``subject`` location. (An empty ``subject 2`` tab is immediately created, in case the photograph has more than one subject.)"
msgstr ""

msgid "In this case most of the data is the same, but I changed ``street`` to the subject of the photograph rather than the place where I was standing."
msgstr ""

msgid "To reorder the subject locations, or to convert between camera and subject, you can drag any of the tabs to another position. If this results in the rightmost tab having data then another tab will be added. If the two rightmost tabs have no data then one of the empty tabs will be removed."
msgstr ""

msgid "Comments or questions? Please subscribe to the Photini mailing list https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/photini and let us know."
msgstr ""

msgid "Configuration"
msgstr ""

msgid "If there are tabs in the Photini GUI that you don't use, you can remove them by deselecting their entry in the ``Options`` menu."
msgstr ""

msgid "The ``Options`` menu also has a ``Settings`` item which opens the dialog shown below."
msgstr ""

msgid "The first three items adjust how Photini uses IPTC-IIM \"legacy\" metadata. (Since 2004 the `IPTC standard`_ uses XMP to store metadata. Photini always writes these XMP fields.) The first option is to always write IPTC-IIM metadata. You may need this if you use other software that reads IPTC-IIM but not XMP. The second option only writes IPTC-IIM metadata if it is already present in the file, as recommended by the `Metadata Working Group`_. The third option is to delete any IPTC-IIM metadata that might be present."
msgstr ""

msgid "IPTC-IIM metadata has limited length for some fields. Photini truncates the IPTC-IIM data if necessary, but the full length data is still stored in Exif and / or XMP. Text that exceeds the IPTC-IIM length is shown with a blue underline. If you don't need to worry about IPTC-IIM compatibility you can disable this warning."
msgstr ""

msgid "Sidecar files allow metadata to be stored without needing to write to the actual image file. If you deselect \"write to image file\" then sidecars will always be created. Otherwise, you can choose to have them always created (storing data in parallel with the image file), only created when necessary (e.g. an image file is write protected), or deleted when possible (if metadata can be copied to the image file the sidecar is deleted)."
msgstr ""

msgid "Finally there are options to adjust file timestamps. \"Keep original\" leaves image files' timestamps unchanged. \"Set to when photo was taken\" changes files' timestamps to the date & time taken (as shown on the technical tab). \"Set to when the file is saved\" sets files' timestamps to when you save the file with Photini, like most other computer programs do. You may find these options useful if you often use a file browser to sort files by date."
msgstr ""

msgid "Spell checking"
msgstr ""

msgid "The ``Spelling`` menu allows you to enable or disable spell checking on Photini's text fields, and to select the language dictionary to use. The available languages depend on what dictionaries you have installed. Adding extra languages on Linux is easy -- just use your system's package manager to install the appropriate dictionary (and make sure you have the appropriate enchant \"backend\" installed)."
msgstr ""

msgid "Windows programs don't share spell checking dictionaries as easily as on Linux. The Hunspell `LibreOffice dictionaries`_ can be used. Select the subdirectory with the language you need (e.g. ``fr_FR`` for French as spoken in France) and download the ``.aff`` and ``.dic`` files. (Ignore hyphen and thesaurus files.) Put these files in the same directory as the English dictionaries installed with pyenchant. On my computer the directory is ``C:\\Users\\Jim\\AppData\\Local\\Programs\\Python\\Python38\\Lib\\`` ``site-packages\\enchant\\data\\mingw64\\share\\enchant\\hunspell`` but this will depend on your Python installation."
msgstr ""

msgid "Configuration file location"
msgstr ""

msgid "Photini stores its configuration in a file called ``editor.ini``. The default location of this file is ``$HOME/.config/photini/`` (Linux), ``$HOME/Library/Preferences/photini`` (MacOS), or ``%USERPROFILE%\\AppData\\Local\\photini\\`` (Windows). If you'd like to store it elsewhere (e.g. on a networked drive so you can share configuration between several computers) you can set an environment variable ``PHOTINI_CONFIG`` to the directory you'd like to use."
msgstr ""

msgid "PyQt options"
msgstr ""

msgid "The configuration file includes options to select use of PyQt5, PyQt6, PySide2, or PySide6. These may be useful if one of these components on your computer is incompatible with Photini. There are so many versions of PyQt that it is impossible to test Photini with every one."
msgstr ""

msgid "The default options in the configuration file are in the ``[pyqt]`` section:"
msgstr ""

msgid "To force use of a particular Qt library set the value of ``qt_lib`` to ``'PyQt5'``, ``'PyQt6'``, ``'PySide2'``, or ``'PySide6'``. (You can also use the ``photini-configure`` command to set this.) You can check which versions Photini is currently using by running it in a command window with the ``--version`` option::"
msgstr ""

msgid "If your computer has a high resolution screen, or you have poor eyesight, you may find the Photini user interface's text is too small to read comfortably. Setting ``scale_factor`` to a value larger than ``1`` should enlarge Photini. Using non-integer values is possible, but might show artefacts from the scaling."
msgstr ""

msgid "Setting the ``native_dialog`` option to ``False`` makes Photini use a Qt dialog to select files to open instead of the normal operating system dialog."
msgstr ""

msgid "Note that there is no GUI to set these options. You may need to adjust them if Photini crashes on startup, in which case the GUI would be unusable. The configuration file can be edited with any plain text editing program."
msgstr ""

msgid "Make sure your editor doesn't change the file's encoding (e.g. from utf-8 to iso-8859) or insert a \"byte order mark\"."
msgstr ""

msgid "Application style"
msgstr ""

msgid "Qt applications can have their appearance changed by selecting different \"styles\". Normally a style is automatically chosen that suits the operating system, but you may want to override this if you prefer something different. For example, on one of my computers the default style doesn't draw lines round the grouped elements on the uploader tabs, so I change the style to one that does."
msgstr ""

msgid "The choice of style affects how some \"widgets\" are drawn. If you find problems such as date or timezone values (on the \"technical metadata\" tab) being partly hidden then it might be worth trying another style."
msgstr ""

msgid "To find out what styles are available on your computer you can use Photini's ``--version`` flag. (You need to run Photini from a command window to do this, see the :ref:`installation troubleshooting<installation-troubleshooting>` section.) You can then try one of these styles as follows::"
msgstr ""

msgid "Note that the style names are not case sensitive. If none of the available styles is to your liking you may be able to install extra ones. For example, on some Ubuntu Linux systems the package ``qt5-style-plugins`` is available."
msgstr ""

msgid "Once you find a style that you like, you can set Photini to use that style by editing the configuration file as described above. Add a line such as ``style = cleanlooks`` to the ``[pyqt]`` section to set your chosen style. Note that after doing this you can not set a different style on the command line unless you remove the ``style = ...`` line from your config file."
msgstr ""

msgid "Tab order"
msgstr ""

msgid "The tabs can be re-ordered by dragging and dropping a tab to your preferred position. This is much easier to do than editing the configuration file."
msgstr ""

msgid "Photini's tabs can be enabled or disabled with the ``Options`` menu as described above, but their order is set in the configuration file. The ``[tabs]`` section has a ``modules`` entry which lists the modules to be imported for each tab. You can reorder the tabs by reordering this list."
msgstr ""

msgid "You could even use a tab provided by another Python package by adding its module name to the list. See :doc:`extending` for more information."
msgstr ""

msgid "Metadata options"
msgstr ""

msgid "Photini can optionally read metadata from \"BMFF\" based filed types CR3, HEIF, HEIC, and AVIF. This requires use of python-exiv2 with libexiv2 v0.27.4 or later. (See :ref:`essential-dependencies` for more details about Photini's dependencies.) Using BMFF files may infringe patents. Please read the `Exiv2 warning`_ before enabling this feature."
msgstr ""

msgid "To enable BMFF file reading, edit the configuration file and set the ``enable_bmff`` option to ``True``:"
msgstr ""

msgid "Descriptive metadata"
msgstr ""

msgid "The ``Descriptive metadata`` tab (keyboard shortcut ``Alt+D``) allows you to edit basic information about your photographs, such as the title and description."
msgstr ""

msgid "The data form is disabled until you select one or more images to edit. Hovering the mouse over one of the data fields displays a popup \"tooltip\" describing the sort of information to put in that field. This help text is taken from the `IPTC standard`_."
msgstr ""

msgid "The first thing I usually do with a new set of photographs is to set the title. Select all the images that should have the same title, then type the title in the ``Title / Object name`` text editing box. Note that the title (and headline and keywords) are stored in XMP and IPTC-IIM but not in Exif, so may not be visible to software that only handles Exif metadata (see :doc:`tag reference <tags>` for more detail). You may prefer to leave these fields blank."
msgstr ""

msgid "The legacy IPTC-IIM standard has a maximum number of bytes for each data item. If your text has more bytes then the excess is shown underlined in blue. You can ignore this if you don't need compatibility with old software that relies on IPTC-IIM data. This warning can be turned off in Photini's :doc:`configuration <configuration>`."
msgstr ""

msgid "The ``Title / Object name`` field has an optional spell checker, enabled with the ``Spelling`` menu. The word \"Château-Gontier\" is not in the British English dictionary, as indicated by the red underlining. Right-clicking on a misspelled word shows any suggested alternatives, one of which can be chosen by clicking on it."
msgstr ""

msgid "Note that all the image thumbnails now have a warning symbol (|hazard|) displayed next to them. This shows that they have unsaved metadata edits. The ``File`` menu ``Save images with new data`` item (keyboard shortcut ``Ctrl+S``) saves your edits and clears the warning symbols, as shown below. I do this frequently to avoid losing any of my work."
msgstr ""

msgid "Now you can add more detail in the ``Headline`` and / or ``Description / Caption`` boxes. (My descriptions are usually so short that a separate headline summary isn't needed.) There are probably only one or two photographs that share the same description, so select those images first."
msgstr ""

msgid "If you select a group of images you may see ``<multiple values>`` displayed in some of the text boxes. You can right-click on the box to bring up a context menu from which you can choose a value to be copied to all the selected photographs. Very long texts are elided with ``...`` replacing some of the text."
msgstr ""

msgid "The ``Alt Text (Accessibility)`` and ``Extended Description (Accessibility)`` boxes are where you describe the photograph for visually impaired users. These are a recent addition to the `IPTC standard`_ - in future image display programs and web sites should use this metadata to create their \"ALT text\" image description."
msgstr ""

msgid "Next you can set a list of keywords for the image by typing them in the ``Keywords`` box. Keywords should be separated by semi-colon (;) characters. The ``<favourites>`` drop-down list can be used to select keywords from the ones you use most often."
msgstr ""

msgid "Finally the ``Rating`` slider allows you to note any particularly good or bad pictures. Good pictures can be given a one to five star rating."
msgstr ""

msgid "Bad pictures can be given a ``reject`` rating. This is stored in the metadata as a rating value of -1."
msgstr ""

msgid "Alternative Languages"
msgstr ""

msgid "Some fields, such as title and description, are stored in XMP as `Lang Alt`_ data. This allows translations into alternative languages to be stored along with the default language text. (Only the default language is stored in Exif and IPTC-IIM.)"
msgstr ""

msgid "Photini has a language drop down selector next to each ``Lang Alt`` data field. If the current text is in an unspecified default language the selector shows ``Language``, otherwise it shows ``Lang:`` and the current language. If the field is empty the current language is set to your computer's default locale. You can add an alternative language by clicking on the drop down and selecting ``<new>``."
msgstr ""

msgid "If there is already some text in an unspecified default language you will be asked to say what that language is. Languages are specified with an RFC3066_ code. This usually starts with a two-letter language code, e.g. ``en`` for English, and may be followed by a hyphen and a two-letter country code, e.g. ``en-GB`` for English as spoken in Great Britain."
msgstr ""

msgid "Next you can set the language to be added, e.g. ``fr-FR`` for French as spoken in France."
msgstr ""

msgid "You can then type the translation in to the text field."
msgstr ""

msgid "If you would like to change the default language, right-click on the ``Lang:`` dropdown and choose a language."
msgstr ""

msgid "More information about the data fields"
msgstr ""

msgid "Click on any field name below to see the IPTC definition and user notes for that field. Although these fields are defined in an `IPTC standard`_, they are all stored in XMP metadata. Some of them are also stored in Exif and/or \"legacy\" IPTC-IIM data."
msgstr ""

msgid "`Title / Object Name <http://www.iptc.org/std/photometadata/specification/IPTC-PhotoMetadata#title>`_"
msgstr ""

msgid "A short title."

msgstr ""

msgid "How good is the photo."
msgstr ""

msgid "Extending Photini"
msgstr ""

msgid "It is possible to add new functionality to Photini by providing a new \"tab\". Because the tabs are loaded dynamically at run-time the new tab does not need to be part of the Photini Python package. For example, if the package ``mypackage`` provides a Photini tab in the module ``mypackage.photini``, then adding ``mypackage.photini`` to the tab modules list (see :ref:`configuration-tabs`) will add the tab to Photini."
msgstr ""

msgid "Every Photini tab has to have the following interface:"
msgstr ""

msgid "The ``tab_name`` method returns the label given to the tab. It should be as short as possible."
msgstr ""

msgid "When the user defines any new metadata you should get the current selection from the ``image_list`` and set the metadata on every image in the selection."
msgstr ""

msgid "It's probably easiest to start with a copy of the Photini tab module most like what you want to do, strip out the bits you don't need and then add your own stuff."
msgstr ""

msgid "Flickr uploader"
msgstr ""

msgid "The ``Flickr upload`` tab (keyboard shortcut ``Alt+F``) allows you to upload your photographs to `Flickr <http://www.flickr.com/>`_, a popular online photograph sharing service. The Flickr upload tab uses the Flickr API but is not endorsed or certified by Flickr."
msgstr ""

msgid "Unlike some other Flickr uploaders, Photini uses the descriptive metadata you've created to set Flickr's title, description and tags. This means you don't have to retype all that information!"
msgstr ""

msgid "Note that the Flickr upload tab is only enabled if you have installed some extra software packages. See :ref:`installation <installation-optional>` for more detail."
msgstr ""

msgid "Initially most of the Flickr uploader tab is disabled. It's only usable after you've authorised Photini to access your Flickr account by clicking the ``Log in`` button."
msgstr ""

msgid "The first time you click ``Log in`` Photini connects your web browser to Flickr, from where you can log in and give Photini permission to access Flickr on your behalf. (Note that Photini does not interact with other people's photos and videos.)"
msgstr ""

msgid "In January 2020 Flickr introduced a bug in the authorisation process. They change the \"callback URL\" from HTTP to HTTPS, which causes an error like the one shown above. (Other browsers may show a different error.)"
msgstr ""

msgid "The workaround is to click on the browser's URL display, change \"https\" to \"http\", then hit the return key."
msgstr ""

msgid "The web browser window can then be closed."
msgstr ""

msgid "If the authorisation is successful Photini displays your Flickr user name and profile picture. You should not need to redo this authorisation process unless you click the ``Log out`` button."
msgstr ""

msgid "Your current Flickr albums are shown on the right hand side of the Flickr uploader tab. You can add a new album with the ``New album`` button. This opens a pop-up dialog as shown below."
msgstr ""

msgid "Type in the album details and click ``OK``. Note that the album will not be created on Flickr until you upload a photo to it."
msgstr ""

msgid "To upload one or more photographs to Flickr, select them in the image selector area, then choose which (if any) of your albums to add them to and set the privacy, safety level and other settings, then click on the ``Start upload`` button."
msgstr ""

msgid "The album membership and privacy & other settings apply to all the photographs in this upload. If you want some photographs to have different album membership or privacy & other settings you need to upload them as a separate batch."
msgstr ""

msgid "During uploading Photini displays a progress bar. Uploading takes place in the background, so you can continue to use other tabs while the upload is in progress. The upload can be stopped by clicking the ``Stop upload`` button."
msgstr ""

msgid "After uploading a photograph it is marked as having new metadata."
msgstr ""

msgid "If you switch to the ``Descriptive metadata`` tab you can see there is a new keyword ``flickr:id=<long-number>``. Photini uses this `triple tag`_ to store the Flickr photo id so it can be used to synchronise metadata later on, as described below."
msgstr ""

msgid "Synchronising local metadata to Flickr"
msgstr ""

msgid "Sometimes you might change your photograph's metadata on Flickr and would like to copy those changes back to the image file on your computer. Select the image(s) you would like to update and click the ``Synchronise`` button."
msgstr ""

msgid "If an image does not have a ``flickr:id`` keyword then Photini will try to find the photograph on Flickr by matching the date and time it was taken. If there is new metadata on Flickr then it is merged into the image's metadata."
msgstr ""

msgid "You can see what changed with the image's context menu ``View changes``. In this case Flickr has set the location city to its new name of \"Château-Gontier-sur-Mayenne\". I chose to ignore this new metadata."
msgstr ""

msgid "Synchronising Flickr metadata to local"
msgstr ""

msgid "If you change your image file metadata and would like to make the same changes on Flickr you can select the image and click on the ``Start upload`` button."
msgstr ""

msgid "If you upload an image that already has a ``flickr:id`` keyword then Photini allows you to change the photograph's metadata instead of uploading a new photograph. You can also replace the image itself, which might be useful if you've processed it in another application."
msgstr ""

msgid "Google Photos uploader"
msgstr ""

msgid "The ``Google Photos upload`` tab (keyboard shortcut ``Alt+P``) allows you to upload your photographs to `Google Photos`_. The Google Photos API is quite restrictive, so 3rd party software such as Photini is rather limited in its abilities."
msgstr ""

msgid "Note that the Google Photos upload tab is only enabled if you have installed some extra software packages. See :ref:`installation <installation-optional>` for more detail."
msgstr ""

msgid "Initially most of the Google Photos uploader tab is disabled. It's only usable after you've authorised Photini to access your Google Photos account by clicking the ``Log in`` button."
msgstr ""

msgid "The first time you click ``Log in`` Photini connects your web browser to Google Photos, from where you can log in and give Photini permission to access Google Photos on your behalf."
msgstr ""

msgid "Unfortunately Google won't verify Photini because it continues to be developed, so you will be presented with several warning messages during the authentication process, and a warning email may be sent to your GMail account."
msgstr ""

msgid "If the authorisation is successful Photini displays your Google Photos user name and profile picture. You should not need to redo this authorisation process unless you click the ``Log out`` button."
msgstr ""

msgid "Your current Google Photos albums are shown on the right hand side of the Google Photos uploader tab. The Google Photos API only allows Photini to add pictures to albums created by Photini. Other albums are shown but are disabled."
msgstr ""

msgid "You can add a new album with the ``New album`` button. This opens a pop-up dialog as shown below."
msgstr ""

msgid "Type in the album title and click ``OK``. The title can be up to 500 characters long, so you may want to enlarge the dialog box."
msgstr ""

msgid "To upload one or more photographs to Google Photos, select them in the image selector area, then choose which (if any) of your albums to add them to, then click on the ``Start upload`` button."
msgstr ""

msgid "Image selector"
msgstr ""

msgid "When you start the Photini editor it displays a GUI (graphical user interface) as shown below. The exact appearance will depend on your operating system and window manager preferences, but the same functional elements should be present. (The appearance can be altered by setting a different style, see the :ref:`configuration section <configuration-style>` for more detail.)"
msgstr ""

msgid "The Photini editor GUI has two main areas. The upper part has a set of tabs to select different functions. The lower part is an image selector that is common to all the tabs. In between the two is a divider that can be dragged with the mouse to change the relative sizes of the two parts. The overall size of the window can also be changed by dragging its edges or corners with the mouse."
msgstr ""

msgid "The tabs can be re-ordered by dragging and dropping a tab to your preferred position."
msgstr ""

msgid "Now load some images using the ``File`` menu ``Open files`` item (or its keyboard shortcut ``Ctrl+O``). The loaded files are displayed as thumbnail images in the image selector part of the GUI. Note that the thumbnail size can be changed with the slider control just beneath the thumbnail display area. The files can also be sorted by name or date by clicking on the appropriate button."
msgstr ""

msgid "Images can also be loaded by \"drag and drop\" from a file manager window or by adding them to the command line if you run Photini from a command terminal. If you open a directory then all the images in that directory will be opened. This is recursive, so beware of accidentally opening too many images in one go."
msgstr ""

msgid "Clicking on any thumbnail selects that file. The selected file is highlighted by a red border. Double clicking on a thumbnail should display the full size image, using your default image viewing application."
msgstr ""

msgid "Multiple files can be selected by holding down the 'shift' key while clicking on a second image. To select multiple files that are not adjacent, hold down the 'control' key while clicking on the images."
msgstr ""

msgid "The keyboard shortcut ``Ctrl+A`` selects all the loaded files."
msgstr ""

msgid "Selecting multiple files allows you to set metadata, such as the image title, on several files at once. This is much quicker than having to edit the metadata of each file separately. You will probably want to select a different group of files before editing each metadata item. For example, you might give the same title to all the images, then select only the first two or three before writing a description."
msgstr ""

msgid "Context menu"
msgstr ""

msgid "Right-clicking on a thumbnail displays a context menu for all the currently selected files."
msgstr ""

msgid "The context menu currently has five items. ``Reload file`` discards any metadata changes. ``Save changes`` saves any changes to the file(s). ``View changes`` displays any changes of metadata, as shown below. ``Regenerate thumbnail`` creates a new thumbnail of the image(s). ``Close file`` closes the file(s)."
msgstr ""

msgid "The ``view changes`` context menu item displays all the metadata items that have changed. In this example I've set two items that were previously empty. If you want to discard any of these changes then select the appropriate ``undo`` checkboxes and click on ``OK``."
msgstr ""

msgid "The same menu items also appear in the main ``File`` menu."
msgstr ""

msgid "Using Photini with other programs"
msgstr ""

msgid "If you use other applications that can display or edit image metadata then you need to be careful when using them with Photini. Just like with a word processor or text editor it can be risky to have a file open for editing in more than one program. If you make changes in Photini you should save them before getting another program to reload or reopen the file. If you make changes in another program you should use the context menu described above to reload the file in Photini."
msgstr ""

msgid "You may also want to experiment with how other programs display the metadata you create in Photini and *vice versa*. Be aware that other programs might not store their metadata in the picture files, but use a database or separate files (other than XMP sidecars). Such programs are not compatible with Photini, unless they can be configured to use metadata standards."
msgstr ""

msgid "Image importer"
msgstr ""

msgid "The ``Import photos`` tab (keyboard shortcut ``Alt+I``) allows you to copy photographs from your digital camera or anywhere else on your computer (for example, a camera memory card if your computer has a card reader). Whilst there are many other programs to do this, I've never found one that does things the way I want, so I added one to Photini."
msgstr ""

msgid "Note that you can only import directly from cameras if you have installed python-gphoto2 (which is not available on Windows). See :ref:`installation <installation-optional>` for more detail."
msgstr ""

msgid "The key part of the importer is the ``Target format`` field. This provides a very flexible way to specify where on your computer imported images should be stored. It uses ``%`` formats to generate file and directory names based on the image capture date & time. The most useful ones are ``%Y`` (year), ``%m`` (month number) and ``%d`` (day of the month) but many more are available. See the `Python documentation <https://docs.python.org/2/library/datetime.html#strftime-strptime-behavior>`_ for a complete list."
msgstr ""

msgid "As well as the date & time format strings, bracketed keywords can be used to manipulate parts of the file name:"

msgid "Note that Photini stores a different target format for each camera or source folder that you use. This can be useful if you have two cameras that use the same file names. For example, I use ``/home/jim/Pictures/from_camera/%Y/%Y_%m_%d/100D_{name}`` for my DSLR to rename files from ``IMG_9999.JPG`` to ``100D_IMG_9999.JPG`` so they don't clash with files from my compact camera, which also uses names like ``IMG_9999.JPG``."

msgid "The ``Ipernity upload`` tab (keyboard shortcut ``Alt+I``) allows you to upload your photographs to `Ipernity <http://www.ipernity.com/>`_, a friendly online photograph sharing club. The Ipernity upload tab uses the Ipernity API but is not endorsed or certified by Ipernity."
msgstr ""

msgid "Unlike some other uploaders, Photini uses the descriptive metadata you've created to set Ipernity's title, description and keywords. This means you don't have to retype all that information!"
msgstr ""

msgid "Note that the Ipernity upload tab is only enabled if you have installed some extra software packages. See :ref:`installation <installation-optional>` for more detail."
msgstr ""

msgid "Initially most of the Ipernity uploader tab is disabled. It's only usable after you've authorised Photini to access your Ipernity account by clicking the ``Log in`` button."
msgstr ""

msgid "The first time you click ``Log in`` Photini connects your web browser to Ipernity, from where you can log in and give Photini permission to access Ipernity on your behalf."

msgstr ""

msgid "The permissions, licence, and album membership apply to all the photographs in this upload. If you want some photographs to have different permissions, licence, or album membership you need to upload them as a separate batch."
msgstr ""

msgid "If you switch to the ``Descriptive metadata`` tab you can see there is a new keyword ``ipernity:id=<long-number>``. Photini uses this `triple tag`_ to store the Ipernity photo id so it can be used to synchronise metadata later on, as described below."
msgstr ""

msgstr ""

msgid "If an image does not have a ``ipernity:id`` keyword then Photini will try to find the photograph on Ipernity by matching the date and time it was taken.

msgid "Geotagging"
msgstr ""

msgid "The map tabs allow you to set the location of where a photograph was taken. Photini currently uses three different map providers: Google, Bing, and Mapbox/OpenStreetMap. All three tabs have similar functionality, but have different styles and levels of detail. Google, Bing, and Mapbox also offer aerial (or \"satellite\") photography."
msgstr ""

msgid "The map initially displays the previously used location. You can change the view by zooming in or out, or by panning the map by dragging it with the mouse. However, it's usually easier to find a specific location by using the search facility."
msgstr ""

msgid "Click on the ``<new search>`` edit box and type in a search term such as the name of a town, then press the 'return' key. A drop down list of place names should appear, from which you can select one. Note that the search box may be disabled for a few seconds after each search to limit the load on the free servers that provide the service."
msgstr ""

msgid "The search is influenced by the current location shown on the map. A search for 'newport' may return different results if the map is showing New York than if it's showing London. You can do a world wide search, ignoring the current location, by clicking on the ``<widen search>`` item in the drop down list. Alternatively you can drag the map to somewhere near where you want to be and then click on the ``<repeat search>`` item in the drop down list."
msgstr ""

msgid "Each map provider has its own search facility. You may get more useful results by switching to a different map tab."
msgstr ""

msgid "Having found the right town, you can then zoom in and pan around to find the exact location where your photograph was taken. Using aerial / satellite imagery can help with this."
msgstr ""

msgid "Now you can drag and drop your photograph onto the map to set its location. To set the same location on multiple images, select them all and then drag and drop one of them."
msgstr ""

msgid "Note that photographs that have location data are shown with a flag symbol (|flag|) in the image selector area."
msgstr ""

msgid "The location coordinates are shown in the ``Lat, long:`` box. These values are editable, so you can set the location of photographs directly, e.g. by copying and pasting from another one. You can also adjust the location by dragging the marker on the map. To clear a photograph's location data just delete the coordinates."
msgstr ""

msgid "When several photographs have location metadata Photini will pan the map (and zoom out if required) to ensure all the selected images are shown on the map. Selected images are shown with coloured markers. Unselected images are shown with grey markers."
msgstr ""

msgid "The ``Get altitude from map`` button sets the photograph's altitude (in metres) from its latitude and longitude, using data from the map provider. Not all map providers have altitude data, and the accuracy varies quite a lot. You can edit the value to correct it."
msgstr ""

msgid "Selecting another map tab will show the same location but with data and imagery from a different provider."
msgstr ""

msgid "GPX file import"
msgstr ""

msgid "If you have a mobile phone or other device with a GPS logger you may be able to set the approximate locations of photographs from logged GPS positions. If you have installed gpxpy_ then the map pages have a button to import GPX files."
msgstr ""

msgid "First you need to export your GPS log as a GPX_ (GPS eXchange format) file, then transfer the .gpx file to your computer. Make sure your images have the correct time zone set so that Photini can calculate their UTC_ timestamps."
msgstr ""

msgid "When a GPX file is imported its track points are displayed on the map as blue circles. If the file has a large number of points, closely positioned in space or time, then not all of them are shown."
msgstr ""

msgid "Selecting a photograph shows up to four track points in red. These are points with time stamps around the time the photograph was taken."
msgstr ""

msgid "After zooming in on the red track points the photograph can be dragged to the map as usual."
msgstr ""

msgid "Alternatively, the ``Set coords from GPX`` button can be used to set the latitude and longitude of all the selected photographs to the nearest (in time) GPX track point."
msgstr ""

msgid "Sometimes GPS receivers lose accuracy, so some GPX file points can be wrong by over 100 metres. In this case the ``Set coords from GPX`` button is not very useful."
msgstr ""

msgid "When you've finished with the GPX track points they can be removed from the map with the ``Remove GPX data`` button."
msgstr ""

msgid "Ownership metadata"
msgstr ""

msgid "The ``Ownership metadata`` tab (keyboard shortcut ``Alt+O``) allows you to edit ownership and copyright information about your photographs."
msgstr ""

msgid "Most of this data will be the same for all your photographs, so Photini uses a \"template\" to apply the same text to all the selected images. If your photographs already have some of this information (some cameras set the creator and copyright notice) you can copy it to the template by selecting one or more photographs and clicking on ``Initialise template``. Otherwise use the ``Edit template`` button to open the dialog shown below."
msgstr ""

msgid "Fill in any of the fields you want to use on every photograph. The field labels are copied from the `IPTC standard`_, as is the help text which should pop up if you hover your mouse over a field. Note that the ``Copyright Notice`` and ``Rights: Usage Terms`` fields can have alternative languages, as discussed in :ref:`alternative-languages`."
msgstr ""

msgid "Note that you can insert the year in which a photograph was taken with ``%Y``. This is probably only useful in the ``Copyright Notice``, but is available for all fields. (You can actually use any directive recognised by the `Python strftime function`_, such as ``%m`` for month number or ``%B`` for the month name.)"
msgstr ""

msgid "The ``Rights: Web Statement`` field is a drop down list of `Creative Commons`_ licences which you can extend with any other licences you use. The widget's context menu allows you to visit any of the licence URLs with your web browser."
msgstr ""

msgid "Google Image Search displays the ``Creator``, ``Credit Line``, and ``Copyright Notice`` values alongside search results. It also uses the ``Rights: Web Statement`` and ``Rights: Licensor URL`` to help people find images that can be licensed for reuse. See the `Quick guide to IPTC Photo Metadata and Google Images`_ for more detail."
msgstr ""

msgid "The ``Apply template`` button copies the template data to all the selected images, setting the correct year in the ``Copyright Notice``. If you want to clear any of the images' existing ownership data when the template is applied, then set the corresponding template field to a single space.

msgid "Technical metadata"
msgstr ""

msgid "The ``Technical metadata`` tab (keyboard shortcut ``Alt+T``) allows you to edit 'technical' information about your photographs, such as the date & time they were taken and the lens that was used (if your camera has interchangable lenses). You can also set the image orientation, which is useful if your camera doesn't set it correctly. (This often happens to me when taking pictures looking almost straight up or down.) I also like to set the time zone of all my pictures, especially when I'm holidaying in another country."
msgstr ""

msgid "The GUI shows three date/time entries - ``taken``, ``digitised`` and ``modified``. These are often the same, and are linked by the ``link ...`` check boxes. These allow you to change all three when you change the ``taken`` date/time."
msgstr ""

msgid "You may wish to unlink the three entries and adjust the dates or times separately. For example, you could use the ``modified`` entry to note when you have edited the metadata with Photini. If you scan some old photographs you should set the ``taken`` entry to when the photographs were taken and the ``digitised`` entry to when you scanned them."
msgstr ""

msgid "The date can be picked from a calendar widget that pops up when you click on the down arrow in a date/time entry. Clicking on any of the numbers allows them to be adjusted with your keyboard up & down arrow keys. You can also double click on any of the numbers to select it and type a new value in directly. Selecting all the numbers, e.g. with ``Ctrl+A``, allows them to be deleted which removes the date & time metadata from the photograph(s)."
msgstr ""

msgid "To the right of each date/time is a widget to adjust the time zone. The time a photograph was taken is assumed to be \"local time\". The time zone records how many hours & minutes offset from UTC (or GMT) the local time zone was when the photograph was taken, digitised or modified."
msgstr ""

msgid "The ``Adjust times`` field allows a constant offset to be applied to the ``taken`` time stamps of several pictures at once. (The other time stamps are also adjusted if the ``link ...`` boxes are checked.) This can be useful if you are in a different time zone to your camera's setting or you forgot to set your camera's clock before a day's shooting! Set the required offset hours, minutes & seconds, then use the ``+`` or ``-`` button to add or subtract that amount from each selected picture's timestamp."
msgstr ""

msgid "You can also offset the time zone. In this example my camera clock was set to British Summer Time (+01:00) but records timestamps without zone information. I was on holiday in mainland Europe (+02:00) so I need to add 1 hour to each timestamp and 2 hours to the time zone. The ``Adjust times`` values are stored in Photini's configuration file, so each day's photos can be given the same offset with just one button click."
msgstr ""

msgid "Below each date/time is a slider that allows you to set the precision. At its maximum value the time is shown to a precision of 1 millisecond. Cameras that can take more than one photograph per second need this precision! Moving the slider to the left removes parts of the date & time. This is useful for scans of old photographs where, for example, you might only know the year and month it was taken in. Setting the precision allows you to record this uncertainty."
msgstr ""

msgid "The ``Orientation`` value sets the required rotation or reflection to display the image. Note that this does not actually transform the image data. Image display programs should rotate or reflect the image according to the orientation metadata, but not all of them do."
msgstr ""

msgid "The ``Camera`` dropdown list shows the camera model and serial number, if known. You can choose a different camera from the list, or click on ``<new>`` to add another camera."
msgstr ""

msgid "It is quite common for the maker's name to appear in the model name, as shown here, but it doesn't have to. The serial number is optional, but could be useful if you have more than one of the same model of camera."
msgstr ""

msgid "After changing the camera you may see this warning message. The makernote_ is a block of proprietary data stored in a photograph's Exif metadata. If you change the camera maker then other software (such as the libexiv2 package used by Photini) may no longer be able to decode the makernote. Deleting the makernote prevents any such errors, but if you have any proprietary software that uses the makernote it may no longer work correctly."
msgstr ""

msgid "The ``Lens model`` dropdown list allows you to change the lens specification stored in the image metadata. This should not usually be changed for cameras with non-removable lenses, but may be useful if you have an SLR that you use with lenses that its electronics doesn't recognise."
msgstr ""

msgid "This is particularly useful if you use your camera with 3rd party lenses and/or telescopes via a T-thread adaptor. My adaptor identifies itself to the camera as a 50mm f/1.8 lens. Here I've used it with my 500mm mirror lens to take some pictures of the moon."
msgstr ""

msgid "Selecting ``<new>`` from the dropdown list allows me to enter details of my mirror lens. As it is not a zoom lens there is no need to fill in the maximum focal length details. Only the ``Model name`` and ``Minimum focal length`` are required information."
msgstr ""

msgid "The data you enter is stored in the Photini configuration file so you can easily apply it to images in future by selecting the lens you have defined from the dropdown list."
msgstr ""

msgid "When the lens model is changed Photini offers the option to adjust the focal length and aperture used for each image, if the current values are inconsistent with the new lens. In this case I definitely do want to update these parameters so I click on ``Yes``."
msgstr ""

msgid "When the mouse pointer is held over the lens model dropdown for a few seconds a \"tooltip\" shows the focal length and aperture details of the lens. This can be useful if they're not obvious from the lens model name."
msgstr ""

msgid "To remove a lens from the list right-click on the list to bring up its context menu. This includes options to delete any lens but the one currently in use."
msgstr ""

msgid "The ``35mm equiv`` field shows the \"`35mm equivalent focal length <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/35_mm_equivalent_focal_length>`_\" of the actual focal length. These two numbers are related by the camera's \"`crop factor <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crop_factor>`_\". Some cameras store both focal length numbers in the image metadata. In this case both numbers are shown normally. If the 35mm equivalent focal length is not present Photini attempts to calculate it from the actual focal length and other metadata. These calculated values are shown in faint text."
msgstr ""

msgid "If you know your camera's crop factor you can correct Photini's calculation by typing in the correct 35mm equivalent focal length. Photini will then store the crop factor for that camera model in its config file for future use."
msgstr ""

msgid "If you don't want to store the 35mm equivalent focal length you entered in the photograph's metadata you can undo the edit by reloading the metadata. Right-click on the thumbnail and select ``reload file`` from the context menu."
msgstr ""

msgid "Now the 35mm equivalent focal length is computed using the correct crop factor."

msgid "Video file handling"
msgstr ""

msgid "Although designed primarily for use with still images Photini can also be used with video files. The :doc:`image_selector` ``Open images`` dialogue normally shows image files only (``.jpg``, ``.gif``, etc.) but has a drop down selector to choose video files (``.mov``, ``.mp4``, etc.) instead, or all file types."
msgstr ""

msgid "The Exiv2_ metadata library cannot write to video files, so Photini will always use XMP sidecars for the metadata you write. Video files can also be rather large, so rewriting them could take some time. Photini can read some metadata from video files if you have installed FFmpeg_ on your computer. (See :ref:`installation - optional dependencies<installation-optional>`.)"
msgstr ""

msgid "Most video files don't have thumbnails, but Photini may be able to create one if you have FFmpeg_ installed on your computer. Right-click on the file and choose ``regenerate thumbnail`` from the popup menu. If Photini is able to generate a thumbnail it will store it in the XMP sidecar file."
msgstr ""

msgid "The :doc:`flickr` tab can upload video files, but expect it to be slow. Video files can be very large."
