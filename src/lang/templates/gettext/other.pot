msgid "Installation"
msgstr ""

msgid "Installation of Photini is done in two parts - first install Python, then use Python to install and run Photini."
msgstr ""

msgid "Installing Python"
msgstr ""

msgid "Python_ is absolutely essential to run Photini. It is already installed on many computers, but on Windows you will probably need to install it yourself."
msgstr ""

msgid "Linux/MacOS"
msgstr ""

msgid "Python should already be installed, but make sure you have Python |nbsp| 3. Open a terminal window and run the ``python3`` command::"
msgstr ""

msgid "Note that the command is ``python3``. On many machines the ``python`` command still runs Python |nbsp| 2. If you do not have Python |nbsp| 3 installed then use your operating system's package manager to install it."
msgstr ""

msgid "You should also check what version of pip_ is installed::"
msgstr ""

msgid "Most Linux systems suppress pip's normal version check, but I recommend upgrading pip anyway::"
msgstr ""

msgid "Note that pip has installed the new version in ``/home/jim/.local`` as normal users can't write to ``/usr``. (Don't be tempted to get round this by using ``sudo`` to run pip. ``/usr`` should only be written by the operating system's package manager.) You may need to log out and then log in again to update your PATH settings."
msgstr ""

msgid "Running ``pip --version`` again shows the new version::"
msgstr ""

msgid "Windows"
msgstr ""

msgid "I suggest reading `Using Python on Windows`_ before you begin. Go to https://www.python.org/downloads/windows/ and choose a suitable Python |nbsp| 3 installer. Use the 64-bit stable release with the highest version number that will run on your version of Windows. Beware of using very new releases though, as some dependencies may not have been updated to work with the latest Python."
msgstr ""

msgid "When you run the Python installer make sure you select the \"add Python to PATH\" option. If you customise your installation then make sure you still select \"pip\". If you would like other users to be able to run Photini then you need to install Python for all users (in the \"Advanced Options\" part of customised installation)."
msgstr ""

msgid "After installing Python, start a command window such as ``cmd.exe``. Now try running pip_::"
msgstr ""

msgid "As suggested, you should upgrade pip now. (If you installed Python for all users you will need to run the shell as administrator.) Note that ``pip`` must be run as ``python -m pip`` when upgrading itself::"
msgstr ""

msgid "Installing Photini"
msgstr ""

msgid "Before installing Photini you need to decide if you are installing it for a single user or for multiple users. Multi-user installations use a Python `virtual environment`_ to create a self contained installation that can easily be shared. Using a virtual environment has other advantages, such as easy uninstallation, so you could also use it for a single user installation."
msgstr ""

msgid "Linux & MacOS users have another decision to make - whether to install Photini's dependencies with pip_ or with the operating system's package manager. For a good introduction to the advantages and disadvantages of each I suggest reading `Managing Python packages the right way`_. All of Photini's dependencies can be installed with pip_, but I recommend installing PySide6 / PySide2 / PyQt6 / PyQt5 (whichever is available) with the package manager to ensure you install all of its system libraries and plugins, and so that you get the same GUI style as other Qt based applications."
msgstr ""

msgid "Virtual environment"
msgstr ""

msgid "If you are using a virtual environment you should set it up now. I use the name ``photini`` and create it in my home directory:"
msgstr ""

msgid "Note that pip may need to be updated again from within the virtual environment. The Linux/MacOS option ``--system-site-packages`` makes packages installed with the system package manager (e.g. PySide6 / PySide2 / PyQt6 / PyQt5) available within the virtual environment. You should stay in this virtual environment while installing and testing Photini."
msgstr ""

msgid "Initial installation"
msgstr ""

msgid "The ``photini-configure`` post installation script can be used to install most dependencies and configure Photini to use them."
msgstr ""

msgid "Firstly install Photini with pip_:"
msgstr ""

msgid "Now run the ``photini-configure`` command to choose which Qt package to use:"
msgstr ""

msgid "The command asks a series of questions, then runs pip_ to install any extra dependencies that are needed, then updates your Photini configuration file."
msgstr ""

msgid "Test the installation"
msgstr ""

msgid "Now you should be able to run photini:"
msgstr ""

msgid "Photini should run successfully, but it lists some optional dependencies that are not installed. These provide additional features, for example the Flickr uploader, that not all users will need to install."
msgstr ""

msgid "Missing system packages"
msgstr ""

msgid "On some Linux systems (e.g. Ubuntu, Debian, Mint) Photini may still not run if you've installed PySide2 or PySide6 with pip_ instead of the system's package manager. In this case it may be worth doing a web search for the error messages you get. For example, failing to load a Qt plugin (on Debian) can be cured by installing just one system package (``libxcb-xinerama0``) but the error message doesn't tell you that!"
msgstr ""

msgid "Optional dependencies"
msgstr ""

msgid "Most of the dependencies required for Photini's optional features can also be installed with ``photini-configure``:"
msgstr ""

msgid "Photini's spelling checker may require some other files to be installed. See the `pyenchant documentation`_ for platform specific instructions."
msgstr ""

msgid "One optional dependency that cannot be installed with pip_ or ``photini-configure`` is FFmpeg_. This is used to read metadata from video files. Linux & MacOS users can install it with the system package manager, but installing it on Windows is non-trivial."
msgstr ""

msgid "Start menu / application menu"
msgstr ""

msgid "Although you can run Photini from a command shell, most users would probably prefer to use the start/application menu or a desktop icon. These can be installed with the ``photini-post-install`` command:"
msgstr ""

msgid "Additional users"
msgstr ""

msgid "If you have installed Photini in a virtual environment then other users should be able to run the ``photini`` command using its full path. (On Windows you will need to share the virtual environment top level directory first.)"
msgstr ""

msgid "This is not a very convenient way to run Photini, so most users will want to add it to their start/application menu:"
msgstr ""

msgid "To install Photini menu shortcuts for all users you can run the post install command as root (Linux) or in a command window run as administrator (Windows). It is important to use the full path to the post install command:"
msgstr ""

msgid "Uninstalling Photini"
msgstr ""

msgid "Before removing Photini you should use the ``photini-post-install`` command to remove it from the start/application menu:"
msgstr ""

msgid "If you used a virtual environment you can simply delete the top level directory created when setting up the virtual environment. Otherwise you can use pip to uninstall Photini and as many of its dependencies as you want to remove:"
msgstr ""

msgid "Updating Photini"
msgstr ""

msgid "When a new release of Photini is issued you can easily update your installation with pip_:"
msgstr ""

msgid "The ``-U`` option tells pip to update Photini to the latest available version."
msgstr ""

msgid "If you upgrade Python you shouldn't need to reinstall Photini or its dependencies if only the patch level changes (e.g. 3.8.9 to 3.8.10). After a more significant Python upgrade (e.g. 3.7.x to 3.8.y) you will need to do a fresh installation of Photini and its dependencies."
msgstr ""

msgid "Dependency details"
msgstr ""

msgid "These lists of dependencies may be useful to Linux or MacOS users who prefer to use their system package manager to install them instead of pip_. Note that in some cases you have a choice of packages, as discussed in the notes below each table."
msgstr ""

msgid "Different operating systems have different names for the same packages. If you run into problems, please let me know (email jim@jim-easterbrook.me.uk) and once we've worked out what needs to be done I'll be able to improve these instructions."

msgid "There are some circumstances where installing Photini from the Python Package Index (PyPI_) with pip_ is not suitable. If you need easy access to the source files, for example to work on translating the user interface into another language, then you should install the development version."
msgstr ""

msgid "Development version"
msgstr ""

msgid "To install the development version you can use git to clone the `GitHub repository <https://github.com/jim-easterbrook/Photini>`_ or download it as a .zip or .tar.gz file and then unpack it. Then set your working directory to the Photini top level directory before continuing."

msgid "String length"

msgid "Words with special meanings"

msgid "Some of Photini's GUI elements such as ``Title / Object Name`` are named after the metadata items in the Exif, XMP or IPTC specifications. If information about these standards is available in your language it may help with translating these words."
msgstr ""

msgid "Formatting strings"
msgstr ""

msgid "In Python curly braces are used to include other data in a string. For example, ``File \"{file_name}\" has {size} bytes and exceeds {service}'s limit of {max_size} bytes.`` includes the file name & size and a size limit set by a service such as Flickr. You should take care not to change what's inside the braces, but you can reorder them if it's appropriate for your language."
msgstr ""

msgid "Carriage returns"
msgstr ""

msgid "Some of Photini's buttons split their labels over two or more lines to stop the button being too wide. You should split your translation in similar size pieces so it has the same number of lines."
msgstr ""

msgid "HTML markup"
msgstr ""

msgid "Strings such as ``<h3>Upload to Flickr has not finished.</h3>`` include HTML markup which must be copied to your translated string. Some strings such as ``<multiple values>`` are not HTML. The angle brackets ``<>`` are used to indicate data with a special meaning. These strings should usually be translated."

msgid "Some strings include a single ampersand character ``&`` immediately before a letter that is used as a keyboard shortcut. You should choose a suitable letter in your translation and place the ampersand appropriately."
msgstr ""

msgid "Plural forms"
msgstr ""

msgid "Translations can accommodate the many ways that languages handle plurals. For example in English we write \"0 files, 1 file, 2 files\". Weblate_ has a separate translation for each plural form. Other translation editors should also handle plural forms."
msgstr ""

msgid "Testing your translation"
msgstr ""

msgid "You need a copy of the Photini source files to test your translation with. You can download or clone this from GitHub (see :ref:`installation-photini`)."
msgstr ""

msgid "If you've been working online then you can download your translation with Weblate's \"Files\" menu. It will have the wrong default name so, for example, make sure you save ``photini-gui-fr.ts`` as ``src/lang/fr/photini.ts``."
msgstr ""

msgid "The translation file needs to be \"compiled\" (converted from ``.ts`` format to ``.qm`` format) before it can be used by the Photini program. This requires the ``pyside6-lrelease`` program, which is part of the ``PySide6`` package on PyPI."
msgstr ""

msgid "You can easily update and compile all the language files::"
msgstr ""

msgid "Now you can install Photini with your new translation(s)::"
msgstr ""

msgid "Photini should use your new language if your computer's ``LANG`` environment variable is set appropriately. You can force this when running Photini from the command line::"
msgstr ""

msgid "Photini should now be using your translations."
msgstr ""

msgid "Translating the documentation"
msgstr ""

msgid "Translating Photini's documentation is a lot more work than translating the program itself. The `\"Read the Docs\" <https://readthedocs.org/>`_ web site can host multiple languages, and I would welcome the chance to add documentation of Photini in other languages. However, translating the program strings is a much higher priority."
msgstr ""

msgid "This uses Transifex_ as described above. The documentation strings are in resources with names like \"src..gettext/manual.pot (master)\"."
msgstr ""

msgid "See the :ref:`notes <localisation-documentation-notes>` below for things to be aware of when translating the documentation."
msgstr ""

msgid "The documentation translation uses ``.po`` files as specified by the `GNU gettext <https://www.gnu.org/software/gettext/>`_ project. You can open the translation file in any editor, but a translation tool is best. For example::"
msgstr ""

msgid "The Photini documentation is written in `reStructuredText <http://docutils.sourceforge.net/rst.html>`_. This is a markup language that looks very like plain text, but uses certain characters to give extra meaning to some parts. You need to take extra care when the string to be translated includes such markup. The markup often needs to be preceded or followed by a space or other punctuation. Take care to copy spaces and punctuation from the English source."
msgstr ""

msgid "Double backquotes ``````"
msgstr ""

msgid "These often mark words that are used in the Photini GUI. You may wish to include the English equivalent in brackets after your translation to help users read the documentation as the screen grabs are all from the English version. For example, the English ````Orientation```` could appear in a German translation as ````Ausrichtung (Orientation)````."
msgstr ""

msgid "Special characters, e.g. ``(|hazard|)``"
msgstr ""

msgid "These refer to Unicode symbols and should not be translated."
msgstr ""

msgid "Short cross references, e.g. ``:doc:`tags```"
msgstr ""

msgid "These should not be translated."
msgstr ""

msgid "Long cross references, e.g. ``:ref:`installation <installation-optional>```"
msgstr ""

msgid "The text within the ``<>`` characters should not be translated, but it may be appropriate to translate the preceding link text."
msgstr ""

msgid "Short external links, e.g. ```Google Photos`_``"
msgstr ""

msgid "If you need to translate the text you can transform the short link into a long one. For example, the English ```Google Photos`_`` could appear in a Korean translation as ```Google 포토 <Google Photos_>`_``. Note the underscores ``_`` and backquotes ````` - they are vital!"
msgstr ""

msgid "Long external links, e.g. ```Flickr <http://www.flickr.com/>`_``"

msgid "The url within the ``<>`` characters should not be translated, but it may be appropriate to translate the preceding link text."

msgid "Typical workflow"
msgstr ""

msgid "This is a suggestion for how to use Photini. It roughly reflects what I do, but is just a guideline for beginners. As you gain experience you may choose to do things differently. There is no requirement to fill in all the metadata fields, nor to do them in any particular order. You might like to adjust the order of Photini's tabs to reflect your preferred workflow. See :ref:`configuration-tabs` for more detail."
msgstr ""

msgid "Make a backup copy"
msgstr ""

msgid "Before editing any of your images' metadata you should make a backup copy. Even if I could guarantee that Photini was bug free and would never corrupt an image file, you still might have a power cut or other computer failure at just the wrong time and ruin a photograph you can never take again. Before you start, please make a backup copy of your photographs."
msgstr ""

msgid "Load images"
msgstr ""

msgid "Select the ``File`` menu ``Open images`` item (keyboard shortcut ``Ctrl+O``). This opens a file selection dialog with which you can navigate to your image folder and select one or more image files to open. If you prefer, you can \"drag and drop\" image files from a file manager window to the Photini editor's image selector."
msgstr ""

msgid "Photini doesn't set a limit to the number of files you can open simultaneously, but it's probably sensible not to open more than 30 or 40, depending on the memory capacity and processing power of your computer. I usually load all the photographs taken on one day, or in one place."
msgstr ""

msgid "Each image file is shown as a thumbnail image in the lower half of the Photini editor GUI. You can adjust the space allocated to this area by clicking and dragging the bar between it and the upper tab area. The thumbnails can be made larger or smaller with the ``thumbnail size`` slider. Choose a size that allows you to see a reasonable number of images, yet still tell one from another. Double click on any thumbnail to view the full size image in your default picture viewing program."
msgstr ""

msgid "Set ownership"
msgstr ""

msgid "I usually start by setting the copyright notice and other information on the ``Ownership metadata`` tab. I select all the images with the keyboard shortcut ``Ctrl+A``, then click the ``Apply template`` button. Then I switch to the ``Descriptive metadata`` tab."
msgstr ""

msgid "Set descriptive metadata"
msgstr ""

msgid "If all your selected pictures have the same title then type it into the ``Title / Object Name`` field now. Otherwise it's time to start selecting single images, or groups of images, and filling in the remaining text fields."
msgstr ""

msgid "The ``Keywords`` field expects a list of words or short phrases, separated by semi-colon (;) characters."
msgstr ""

msgid "Save your work so far"
msgstr ""

msgid "As you proceed it's a good idea to save the images that have new metadata with the ``File`` menu ``Save images with new data`` item (keyboard shortcut ``Ctrl+S``). Any images with unsaved metadata have thumbnails marked with a warning symbol (|hazard|)."
msgstr ""

msgid "Set geolocation"
msgstr ""

msgid "Amongst the commonly used image metadata items are the latitude and longitude of the position from which the photograph was taken. (Some people argue that it should be the position of the subject of the photograph, but what about photographs of the Moon?) Photini makes it easy to set the latitude and longitude of any photograph by dragging and dropping it onto a map."
msgstr ""

msgid "There are currently three map tabs in the Photini editor, each of which gets maps (or aerial photographs) from a different provider: Google, Microsoft Bing, and Mapbox. (Each of these providers has terms and conditions you should read and accept before using their maps.) The maps differ in appearance, and show different levels of detail for different parts of the world. You should use the one that you like best, but it's very easy to switch to another at any time."
msgstr ""

msgid "You may be able use the map's navigation and zoom controls to find the area you want, but usually you will need to use the search box. Click on ``<new search>`` and type in a search term such as the name of a town. Note that the search is biased towards the current map location, so you might want to zoom out and pan to the right continent before searching. Type a search term into the box and hit return. A list of results should appear very soon, from which you can choose the one you want. Each map provider has its own search engine, so if you can't find the place you are looking for it might be worth trying a different provider."
msgstr ""

msgid "Now zoom in and drag the map to home in on the place where your photographs were taken. Select one or more images that have a particular location and drag them onto the map. A marker should appear on the map and the latitude and longitude values will be displayed below the search box. The marker can be dragged around the map to adjust its position - you may find it easier to select the map's aerial or satellite option, at the highest zoom available, to set the exact position. Each image that has had a location set has its thumbnail marked with a flag symbol (|flag|)."
